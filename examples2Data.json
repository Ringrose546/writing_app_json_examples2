","FLP is more thermolabile, having an optimum near 30 degrees C and little detectable activity above 39 degrees C. "," Cre is optimally efficient at 37 degrees C and above. ", "Consistent with FLP thermolability, recombination in a mammalian cell line mediated by a ligand- regulated FLP-androgen receptor fusion protein is more efficient at 35 degrees C than at higher temperatures.
